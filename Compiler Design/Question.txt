1. Write a C/C++ program that reads text from a file and prints on the terminal each input line, preceded by the line number. The output will look like -
                    1 This is the first trial line in the file,
                    2 and this is the second line.
                    
    Try the problem once using fgetc() function and once using fgets() function for reading the input. Why is fread() not suitable for this purpose?

2. Write a C/C++ program to identify whether a given input line is a comment or not. 


3. Write a C/C++ program to test whether a given identifier is valid or not.


4. Write a C/C++ program that reads text from a file, then count and prints the number of 
character exist in the inputted text file. 


5. Write a C/C++ program that reads text from a file, then count and prints the number of 
line exist in the inputted text file.


6. Write a C/C++ program that reads text from a file, then delete the existing comment and
save the output text file (without comment). Also count and print the number of deletion. 


7. Write a C/C++ program that reads text from a file, then delete the existing tabs (spaces)
and new line and save the output text file. Also count and print the number of deletion.
